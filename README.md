Smart Book Safe
For our Embedded Systems final project, we implemented an embedded system using an Arduino Mega 2560 R3 microcontroller, along with various sensors and actuators. 
These components communicate with each other, sending and receiving commands and data from a main hub. The main hub, controlled by the user, interfaces through a Wi-Fi module (ESP8266) and a Bluetooth module (HC-06/BlueSMiRF).
This setup allows for the control of environmental conditions and security features in a specific room, such as a book safe.
